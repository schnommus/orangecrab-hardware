    * Finished board thickness is 1.6 mm.
    * Place UL mark and date code on legend on backside of board.

Impedances

    Control to within 10%.

    Layer 1 microstrip (ref to layer 2 Ground)
        121 μm trace = 50 ohm single ended

    Layer 3 microstrip (ref to layer 2 Ground / 4 Power)
        121 μm trace = 50 ohm single ended
        105 μm trace / 150 μm space = 100 ohm differential
        130 μm trace / 150 μm space = 90 ohm differential

    Layer 6 microstrip (ref to layer 5 Ground)
        121 μm trace = 50 ohm single ended
        105 μm trace / 150 μm space = 100 ohm differential
